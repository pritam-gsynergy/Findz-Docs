# Install the Findz' browser extension

### What is the Findz’ browser extension?

The **Findz’ browser extensions** let you save and share bookmarks from Chrome and Safari on your laptop. 

Simply add the Findz extension from the browser's extension store, pin it to the browser, and tap on it to add the current page to groups or collections of your choice.

Let's discover **what you can do on the Findz' browser extension**.

### Enrich links into finds

On the powerful Findz’ browser extension, you can enrich a regular link with useful details such as **title, description, vendor, price and location.** You can also **sort** the find into new or existing **collections and sub-collections.**

Download the Findz' Chrome/Safari extension from the **[extension store](https://findz.app)**.

### Single-click import all your browser bookmarks

If you are a link hoarder who has hundreds of bookmarks scattered across multiple browsers and devices, then you can **give all your bookmarks a permanent address** using the Findz extension. Just export all your saved bookmarks from the browser and import them into Findz using the **easy single-click import button** on the extension window. 

Findz will:
- **Automatically sort** the bookmarks into the same collections and sub-collections as you had sorted them on your browser.
- **Add top images or favicons** from the webpage to give you a visual cue about what the link is about.

### Share the link directly on your groups

If you found a useful article about awesome places in Europe, share it directly on the Findz group with your buddies who're joining you for a Europe trip this summer.

Just select the group you want to share the link with, add necessary details and click on the **Add Find** button to share the find directly to your groups. 

### Sync with the app in realtime 

When you add a new find, import browser bookmarks or share finds on your groups from the extension, Findz **instantly syncs** them up with the mobile app where you can **view, modify, share, delete or reorganize them.**
